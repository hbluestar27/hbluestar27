Having over 15 years of experience, I have strong hands and top-notch skills in web development. <br/>
Back in 2005, I started with PHP and MySQL then get interested in Wordpress, Woocommerce. I have worked on successful wordpress projects and took part in database management system of a big enterprise as well. <br/>
I found that marketing through the ecommerce became popular and expanded rapidly hence started to focus on working with Woocommerce, OpenCart, Nopcommerce and Shopify and now there are successful products. <br/>
After that modern PHP and Javascript frameworks attracted me and devoted myself to learn them such as Laravel, Node, React, Vue, Angular etc. Throughout the history of working with new technologies, I have gained rich experience with those techs and provided high quality products to customers.<br/>
In 2019, I've discovered blockchain and got very excited about this new technology that was innovative and ambitious and I am currently working on Blockchain development using open-source blockchain projects (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, etc.).
Due to the very high-speed improvement of the blockchain sphere, I'm constantly learning and trying new technologies and solutions.<br/>
With good communication skill, I have high level understanding of business management and find solutions.
